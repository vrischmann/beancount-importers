# Beancount Importers

This repository contains importers for [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) which are capable of processing CSV exports from two french banks:

* [Fortuneo](https://fortuneo.fr)
* [Cr√©dit Mutuel](https://creditmutuel.fr)

This is _not_ a tool that automically fetches CSV exports from the bank: you need to download the CSV files yourself.
